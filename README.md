# probability-statistics-python

Python implementations of **Probability & Statistics fundamentals**, paired with **interactive visual simulations**, building the mathematical foundation for **Machine Learning and AI**.

## Overview

This repository is part of **Phase 2** of my structured **AI / Machine Learning study path**.

The focus here is on understanding probability and statistics *properly* — not just formulas, but intuition, simulations, and how these ideas behave in practice.

Each topic is approached from two angles:

* **Python simulations and calculations** for mathematical understanding
* **Interactive web-based visualisations** to make abstract ideas tangible

## What This Covers

This project builds on concepts from:

* **Khan Academy – Probability & Statistics**
* MIT-style mathematical thinking
* Practical experimentation through code and simulation

Topics include (added progressively):

* Basic probability (coins, dice, number ranges)
* Sample spaces and events
* Conditional probability
* Independence
* Bayes’ theorem
* Random variables
* Distributions (Bernoulli, Binomial, Normal)
* Expectation and variance
* Simulations (Monte Carlo)
* Classic problems (Monty Hall, etc.)

---

## Interactive Probability Web App

Alongside the Python work, I’ve built a **React-based Probability & Statistics Web App** that visually demonstrates key concepts.

Current simulations include:

* Coin flip simulation with history tracking
* Dice roll simulation with animated dice faces
* Random number range generator
* Interactive Monty Hall problem

These visuals help reinforce intuition before diving deeper into formal mathematics and ML applications.

## Project Structure

Each folder represents a topic or week of study and contains:

* **Notes (`.md`)** – concepts explained in plain language
* **Python scripts (`.py`)** – simulations and calculations
* **Optional plots** – visual intuition where useful
* **Web components (when applicable)** – interactive demonstrations

Example structure:

```
Week-1-Basic-Probability/
├── notes.md
├── coin_and_dice.py
├── monty_hall.py
```

## Why This Matters for ML

Probability and statistics sit at the core of:

* model uncertainty
* loss functions
* optimisation
* evaluation metrics
* Bayesian reasoning

This repository exists to ensure these foundations are solid *before* moving into machine learning algorithms and deep learning systems.

## Tech Stack

**Python side**

* Python
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Jupyter (optional)

**Web visualisation side**

* React
* JavaScript
* CSS animations

**General**

* Git & GitHub

---

## Setup

Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

Run a script:

```bash
python coin_probability.py
```

## Learning Path Context

This repository is **Phase 2** of my AI / ML roadmap:

1. **Phase 1:** Python + Linear Algebra ✅
2. **Phase 2:** Probability & Statistics ⬅️ *current*
3. **Phase 3:** Machine Learning (scikit-learn)
4. **Phase 4:** Deep Learning (PyTorch / TensorFlow)
5. **Phase 5:** Deployment & Portfolio Projects

---

## Learning Method

Each concept is:

1. Studied visually and theoretically
2. Written out in my own words
3. Implemented or simulated in Python
4. Reinforced through interactive visualisation where useful

The goal is deep understanding, not surface-level familiarity.
