# probability-statistics-python

Python implementations of **Probability & Statistics fundamentals** — building the mathematical foundation for **Machine Learning and AI**.

---

## Overview

This repository is part of **Phase 2** of my structured **AI / Machine Learning study path**.

The focus here is on understanding probability and statistics *properly* — not just formulas, but intuition, simulations, and how these ideas show up in real ML problems.

Each topic is backed by:

* clear written notes
* small Python scripts
* simulations to make abstract ideas concrete

---

## What This Covers

This project builds on concepts from:

* **Khan Academy – Probability & Statistics**
* MIT-style mathematical thinking
* Practical Python experimentation

Topics include (added progressively):

* Basic probability (coins, dice, number ranges)
* Sample spaces and events
* Conditional probability
* Independence
* Bayes’ theorem
* Random variables
* Distributions (Bernoulli, Binomial, Normal)
* Expectation and variance
* Simulations (Monte Carlo)
* Classic problems (Monty Hall, etc.)

---

## Project Structure

Each folder represents a topic or week of study and contains:

* **Notes (`.md`)** – concepts explained in plain language
* **Python scripts (`.py`)** – simulations and calculations
* **Optional plots** – visual intuition where useful

Example structure:

```
Week-1-Basic-Probability/
├── notes.md
├── coin_and_dice.py
├── monty_hall.py
```

## Why This Matters for ML

Probability and statistics are at the core of:

* model uncertainty
* loss functions
* optimization
* evaluation metrics
* Bayesian models

This repo exists to make sure those foundations are solid *before* moving deeper into ML algorithms.

## Tech Stack

* **Python**
* **NumPy**
* **Matplotlib**
* **Jupyter (optional)**
* **Git & GitHub**

---

## Setup

Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

Run a script:

```bash
python coin_probability.py
```

## Learning Path Context

This repository is **Phase 2** of my AI / ML roadmap:

1. **Phase 1:** Python + Linear Algebra ✅
2. **Phase 2:** Probability & Statistics ⬅️ *current*
3. **Phase 3:** Machine Learning (scikit-learn)
4. **Phase 4:** Deep Learning (PyTorch / TensorFlow)
5. **Phase 5:** Deployment & Portfolio Projects
